 <p>Hello, ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>First, I'd like to thank you for your contributions so far to the Extrasolar Project! We rely on the determination of volunteers like you to keep this project moving.</p>
 <p>At the risk of pulling you away from your core mission of exploring the island and identifying new alien species, we'd like to ask for your assistance in a special task. When your landing capsule touched down, the cameras used by the landing system caught a glimpse of a reflective object -- likely a piece of the discarded heat shield.  We've reviewed the telemetry data to help pinpoint the item's location.</p>
 <p>We just added a new mission to your task list to encourage you to take some photos at that location. To help you, I added a ${msg.user.crosslink_region('marker to your map', 'RGN_ARTIFACT01_WAYPOINT', 'RGN_ARTIFACT01_ICON')}, about 150 meters southwest of your current position.  You may need to zoom out the map view to see it. If you find anything at that location please tag it in your gallery, just as you've been tagging species for Dr. Eastwood.</p>
 <p class="pspace">Thank you for your assistance,</p>
 <p> - Dr. Robert Turing</p>

body: |-
 <%include file="turing_header.html"/>
 <p>This is bad news.</p>
 <p>Our rovers are pretty robust, but the JR-class rover that you're driving is not well-suited for deep sand.  We have a tethering subsystem in place to keep this class of rover within a designated area, but that subsystem failed somehow and you're headed toward trouble.</p>
 <p>Ideally, I'd override your rover's command, but it's not that simple.  We can usually cancel commands that haven't started execution yet, but due to satellite orbit and transmission delays, once a rover has started moving to its next destination, we're out of options.</p>
 <p>We set conservative bounds for our rovers, so hopefully we'll be able to bring it back safely.  Please direct it back toward the landing capsule as soon as possible and minimize the distance you traverse over loose sand or gravel.</p>

 <p>Hi ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>Something's happened. I'd say that this was our worst fear -- but honestly, it's worse than that. Your rover isn't just stuck -- it's not responding to any commands at all.  We've been digging through the diagnostic data, but it's not clear what happened.</p>
 <p>My records seem to show that you're in good standing and you've contributed some influential photographs to our collection, so you've actually qualified for a security upgrade. As a result, I've activated a new rover for you that is still situated near the landing capsule. This rover is more advanced than your previous one, so please treat it carefully, but it should be able to traverse those dunes with no problem.</p>
 <p>Since you'll now be able to safely drive in that area, please pay your old rover a visit. If you can take a clear photo of it and tag it for us, it will help us diagnose the extent of the problem and decide a next step.</p>
 <p class="pspace">I put a ${msg.user.crosslink_mission('new mission', 'MIS_FIND_STUCK_ROVER')} in your task list and put a ${msg.user.crosslink_region('marker on your map', 'RGN_FIND_STUCK_ROVER_WAYPOINT')} of the expected rover location.</p>

 <p>I just got my first look at the recent photo you took of our stranded rover, and... well...</p>
 <p>Since you have a level 3 security clearance now, I guess I'll say that it definitely seems damaged somehow. And there are some interesting objects nearby. We'll have to study those further, but I'll take care of that, and your old rover.</p>
 <p>Despite the damage to the rover, this could be exciting -- I suspect an animal life-form may have been involved in the damage, which could be our first evidence of such life on Epsilon Prime!</p>
 <p>You can keep this SR-K -- and given that it has the audio upgrade, maybe we can figure out what happened to your JR-S. We've seen no animals, but maybe we can hear one instead!  Your rover's passive audio detectors are now active and should alert you to any sounds that exceed a preset decibel threshold.</p>
 <p>I would like you to proceed up the sandy embankment north of your current position and head toward the island's central plateau.  I've marked the region of interest on your map.  There's no hurry.  If you encounter any signs of animal life along the way, I encourage you to take a closer look.</p>
 <p>Oh -- and remember that any conversations that take place here fall under the sensitive information non-disclosure agreement you signed when you underwent our security evaluation. The PR people will want to be in charge of when they announce finding animal life, if we do!</p>

 <p>Listen to that! Wind rustling the plants, waves on the shore! Nothing quite like hearing another planet to make it seem so much more real. I still sometimes can't believe we're doing this.</p>
 <p>More importantly, do you hear that sound near the end of the clip? Could be the sound of an animal, as I hoped.</p>
 <p>I've been discussing it with Jane and we have a bit of a theory. Besides the ability to record audio, the SR-K rover also has the ability to play audio, through on-board speakers. We'd like to experiment with what happens when we play back the animal's sound onto the planet's surface. Perhaps it will attract the animal back, or attract a predator, and we can catch it on camera.</p>
 <p class="pspace">Take another picture of the location where we've pinpointed the audio source; the rover will automatically play back the sound you recorded when you do, and we'll see what happens.</p>

 <p>Hi ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>We've certainly been pleased with your work so far. Thanks for continuing to be a valuable part of the Extrasolar Project.</p>
 <p>I have a special mission for you. We recently deployed a new GPS unit on the north part of the island, and it started picking up some strange electromagnetic signals. We've managed to triangulate the origin of the signals -- since it's beyond the zone that most of the rovers are restricted to, I'd like you to check out the source of the signals for us. Head over there and take a photograph of it, so we can see what's making them.</p>

 <p>Hi ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>Wow. I mean, just -- wow. I just can't even -- I mean, there's just no denying that those are alien structures of some kind.</p>
 <p>See, the signal XRI received those years ago was incomplete and corrupted, but Gordon Cavendish managed to decode it into a series of symbols -- writing. With the help of a crack linguistics team, he made an approximate translation. The message simply indicated that there was life on Epsilon Prime, that these aliens considered themselves "caretakers" of the planet, and that as a result, others were warned to stay away.</p>
 <p>These structures -- these must be from the Caretakers. It's mind-blowing, to see the creations of other intelligent life -- intelligent life! We're really not alone in the galaxy. But where are they? I'd like you to take at least 2 more photographs of these structures, and don't forget to tag them -- let's get as much evidence as we can.</p>

 <p>Hi, ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()}!</p>
 <p>I find myself very interested in these obelisks you keep finding. Each one is covered in writing, and emits a very basic audio signal -- what I can't figure out is their purpose. They seem to be monuments of some sort -- could they possibly have had a utilitarian function for the Caretakers? Perhaps they had some religious significance. We've barely scratched the surface of this civilization and their technology. Maybe their function is simply beyond our understanding.</p>
 <p>With further evidence, perhaps we will be able to unravel these mysteries and begin to understand them. I've noticed a pattern in the locations of these monuments -- they seem to be arranged in a hexagon, centered on the large monument that you found earlier. Their positions so far suggest that there are two more -- I'll mark them on your map.</p>
 <p>One more thing -- we've been having some trouble with our servers. It looks like there's been some kind of tampering. If you experience any technical problems, it's probably just us trying to fix the security. Thanks for your patience.</p>

 <p>Hi ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>

 <p>I honestly can't say I know what to think about this. That you've known, that you've been helping Alexis -- or "Kryptex81". I guess that would explain the pictures, then. And there I was thinking the ID codes of GPS units would be safe passwords because they'd be hidden on another planet! It would have worked as a defense against Alexis alone, but you managed to be just enough of an insider to sneak her back in. Our security team would be blown away by what you two have done... not that I'm about to share any of this with them.</p>

 <p>But seeing these documents -- I mean, I guess I have no reason not to keep trusting you. You've helped me still, even as you've done this. And... I have to know what's going on. Especially if it could endanger the mission.</p>

 <p>Edna's just a middleman between XRI and the DoD, right? If Arling gets shut down -- XRI would stop getting funding from her. Extrasolar will be terminated.</p>
 <p>It may be for the wrong reasons, but what XRI is doing is still extremely valuable. The things we're discovering -- life in the universe! Can we just give that up?</p>
 <p>I mean --  I'm not in favor of government fraud and theft, but -- all the money's coming from military programs and being diverted to, well, <em>science</em>. Research. And frankly, ultimately, the survival of the species via space exploration.</p>

 <p>Kryptex -- Noam was your father? Then I'm sorry. He was a good guy.</p>
 <p>Edna may be giving us that money now, even without Arling's support, but if he gets completely shut down and exposed, that cashflow <em>will</em> stop. They'll look into it -- they'll have to.</p>
 <p>But... What if we can get the best of both worlds? -- so to speak.</p>
 <p>If Arling knows we have the power to bring him down, to ruin him completely -- and we can make sure that if anything happens to us, the world will know -- then we're protected. And since Arling's lost control of Edna anyway -- if the lie isn't <em>exposed</em>, she can keep getting the money and sending it to us -- XRI's getting all the funding it needs, and Arling has nothing. If we make him that much more powerless--</p>
 <p>Well, from what little I know of Arling, that'll be as good as any punishment the military can give. He won't dare use his DoD influence lest we bring him down completely. And XRI gets to stay operational.</p>
 <p>Edna -- whoever she is -- will keep giving us the money we need, no one any the wiser.</p>

 <p>Something's wrong.  Immediately after your rover arrived at the north shore, it started exhibiting the same connectivity issues as the other rover that went missing.  From your map, it looks like it's tumbled off the cliff and gone for a swim -- an activity for which this model is poorly suited.</p>
 <p>We're getting seismic data back from the landing capsules -- it looks like there was an earthquake when you activated that central monument. We're trying to figure out what happened.</p>
 <p>In our last communication with your rover, it indicated its location several hundred meters offshore. If your rover loses contact with all other units, it's designed to initiate a high-power beacon to try to reestablish a connection.  It will attempt to send a photo every hour.  It's scheduled its first attempt, which means that we are still getting at least intermittent connectivity.</p>

 <p>The rover will continue to attempt reconnection in a high-power distress mode for 24 hours.

 <p>Hi ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>I shouldn't have any trouble convincing Cavendish to try to send down a landing capsule or GPS unit to the new island where your rover was stranded. That will allow us to reestablish a reliable connection and hopefully get some useful information about what happened.  After all, exploring more of this planet is why we sent so many rovers in the first place, and this new island seems as compelling as any.</p>
 <p>But that's going to take time -- maybe months.  I'm sure that Jane will appreciate it if you continue to catalog species on Artocos Island, but I'll be out of contact for a bit while I line up the resources we need to answer some of the bigger mysteries of Epsilon Prime. As long as you have alerts enabled in your profile settings, you'll get notified by email when I have news.</p>
 <p>You've been such an asset to this team that I definitely want to share the next piece of this adventure with you. It seems only fair to give <a class="credit-link" href="http://www.exoresearch.com/credits" target="_blank">credit where credit is due</a> -- and despite some questionable actions, it seems that you, me and Alexis are all on the same side.</p>

 <p>I'm not even sure where to start on this one. I mean, we deliberately sent a lot of rovers in case problems like this happened, but it's still a huge cost when someone drives one into the ocean. To be clear, our team wrote the tethering algorithms, so I'm not necessarily saying this is your fault, but it appears that someone screwed up.</p>
 <p>That being said, science must go on and we're lucky that we designed our rovers with inhospitable conditions in mind.  Not only did we get one last shot, but it included the full-spectrum data and the results are pretty interesting.</p>
 <p>We haven't calibrated our sensors for underwater photography, but based on the data that we have, it seems likely that you managed to tag at least one motobiont.  Beyond that, I'm hesitant to speculate. We have a hard enough time exploring the oceans of our own planet.  Trying to catalog the species in the ocean on another planet is a truly terrifying prospect.</p>

 <p>This photo is unbelievable!  I'm not sure where this was taken and I can't seen to get a straight answer from Turing or Cavendish.  I can't figure out if they're being evasive or if they're just as mystified as I am.</p>
 <p>It looks like a completely different ecosystem.  You have like six species in a single photo! It's so lush!  Look how dense they are!  Everything we've seen so far has had a "desert island" vibe, but I thought maybe that's just how things are in low oxygen environments or with an entirely different evolutionary history or a thousand other reasons -- but no!  Things can be all crammed together!  Most of the photobionts have characteristics we're familiar with -- cnideria, bulbos, an elongated version of the polystem -- but some things are new and strange and different!  I'm not even sure where one organism begins and another ends!</p>
 <p>I'm reluctant to give too much analysis, much less try to name any of these species, as this is the only image I have to work from so far.  Identifying half a dozen species from a single photograph seems like hubris -- but rest assured, if we can get more data about these species, you'll get naming credit.</p>

 <p>Hello,</p>
 <p>I'm Jane Eastwood, lead exobiologist for the Extrasolar project. It is a great opportunity to be the first to catalogue and study life on another planet.  </p>
 <p>As we posted on the XRI website, early readings and images confirmed our suspicions that Epsilon Prime supports life. Seeing the first pictures we got back from rovers was an incredible experience. Now we'll learn what we can about these organisms: Do they follow the same principles as life on Earth? How do they survive? How have they evolved--and do the same tenets of evolution hold?</p>
 <p>Our science team controls a specialized science rover with tools for many biological tests. Part of your job while you explore for Dr. Turing is to scout for us--based on the organisms you tag, we'll know where to find new specimens and good test subjects.</p>
 <p>To begin, simply identify some unique species in the area around the lander. This will give us a good introduction to the species of the island. Tag as many organisms as you can--the more samples we have, the more accurate our work will be.</p>
 <p>Thanks, and I look forward to seeing what we discover.</p>

 <p>Hello ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>Thank you for the amount of organism data you've sent in so far. The biology team has already started speculating on how life has evolved on Epsilon Prime.</p>
 <p>We've been referring to these organisms as "photobionts" for lack of better information, but we don't actually know if they're photosynthetic. (I mean, that is their name. We wrote it down. If they aren't photosynthetic, they will still have the same name, but for the rest of time, there will be a note *Named when VanSust thought they were photosynthetic.) None of them are green, which is the colour of chlorophyll <em>a</em>--the only major photosynthesizing pigment we have on Earth. But as you know, there are many Earth plants where other coloured pigments mask the green colour.</p>
 <p>We've been collecting tissue from some of the photobionts you've tagged, and will be using a spectrometer on them. This will tell us the chemical makeup of the organisms by heating the samples to incandescence using a heating element on our rover, and then measuring the spectra (or the varying wavelengths) that the sample produces when it incandesces. Given that the oxygen levels on Epsilon Prime are so low, the samples should incandesce nicely without combusting. </p>
 <p>We will then put samples in the fluorometer--photosynthetic organisms convert photons to chemical energy, but a small percentage of photons escape transformed into longer wavelengths. We'll look for wavelengths of light that are adsorbed by the tissue and emit slightly redder wavelengths.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile--this is fascinating stuff--you'll be establishing type specimens--via photos, no less--which will form the basis for all future definitions of this species. See my ${msg.embed_blog_link('exobiology', 'blog post')} for more details.</p>
 <p>Please continue to tag as many examples of each species as possible. It helps us measure, define, and categorize. I've gone ahead and updated your task list with another task tracking the number of unique species you've identified.</p>
 <p>Thanks for your continued support,</p>

subject: "Oops"
body: |-
 <%include file="jane_header.html"/>
 <p>After what appeared to be technical issues with the science rover, it now appears that I caused a fire. So...whoops. Applying heat to the tissue sample shouldn't have allowed for combustion, and yet it seems that the tissue sample basically exploded in a small fireball--a surprise because the atmosphere isn't sufficiently oxygen rich to support combustion of most compounds. The only thing that could combust in such a oxygen poor atmosphere is hydrogen (or oxygen and something flammable)--so oddly enough, we now have compelling evidence that these organisms are accumulating and storing volatile gas. This is cold comfort, given the damage to our sampling equipment.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, my mistake resulted in some damage to the science rover. Our spectrometer and fluorometer don't appear to be functioning properly; we're still assessing additional damage.</p>
 <p>So this is going to be fun, now.</p>
 <p>What this means, of course, is that we're going to have to get creative in our methods for performing the tests we need to perform. For instance, we'll have to use some older techniques that biologists used before modern technology. Luckily for you, many of these techniques are based on purely visual measurements--so you and your photographs can be of great help! If you're interested, I've written a bit about methodology for the ${msg.embed_blog_link('bio_methods', 'XRI website')}.</p>

 <p>Hello ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>Since using the spectrometer caused a fire that damaged our fluorometer, we're going to have to get a little creative to determine if these photobionts are actually photosynthetic.</p>
 <p>My method is actually quite simple: deny sunlight to a selection of organisms and see if they die. We've scavenged some parachute material from the landing capsule to cover the organisms.</p>
 <p>However, a member of my team pointed out that killing these organisms is an ethical grey area, especially if there are only a few specimens of a species in existence on the island. Therefore, I have a new task for you, since you've now been assigned our first SRK rover and can explore beyond the dunes that previously prevented us from leaving our initial landing zone: find more examples of the species that we're calling spindlepus, serpentweed, and aircomber, to make sure they're prominent elsewhere on the island, before we kill all the ones by the lander.</p>

 <p>Now that you've determined that the serpentweed is common outside of the peninsula where the lander is, we will begin experiments on it. We'll use the scavenged parachute material to cover the photobiont. This will hopefully reduce almost all incident light.</p>
 <p>This approach does have significant flaws; the parachute material may hamper air circulation and gas exchange. Ideally we'd find a way to ensure air circulation, but since we're coming up with new experiments for something on a different planet, we have to accept some flaws.</p>

 <p>Now that you've determined that the spindlepus is common outside of the peninsula where the lander is, we will begin experiments on it. We'll use the scavenged parachute material to cover the photobiont. This will hopefully reduce almost all incident light.</p>
 <p>This approach does have significant flaws; the parachute material may hamper air circulation and gas exchange. Ideally we'd find a way to ensure air circulation, but since we're coming up with new experiments for something on a different planet, we have to accept some flaws.</p>

 <p>We've denied sunlight to a spindlepus for seven days now, and we've yet to see any major change in its physiology. It seems to be surviving without problems. It may just be very effective at living on its accumulated energy stores, or it may not be photosynthetic--it may instead be getting energy from the atmosphere, its root system, or other sources.</p>

 <p>I've been talking a lot about convergent evolution; how the photobionts on Artocos superficially resemble desert plants on Earth because both habitats have limited water, and thus organisms are compact to minimize the area that's available for water loss. (Also they have thick skins to prevent evaporation, lots of tiny hairs to reflect excess sunlight, and spines, because making new tissue is water- and resource-intensive.)</p>
 <p>What I've been glossing over is the giant feathery organs (cnideria), sacs of volatile gas (bulbos), and apparently nonsensical multiple stems (polystems). These things don't prevent water loss--in fact, they probably increase it. Why do photobionts have such expensive structures? (Expensive in terms of energy produced and nutrients gathered.)</p>
 <p>I now have a probable explanation! Remember way back before we landed--when I mentioned the unusually high hydrocarbon levels in the atmosphere? It seems like heavier gaseous hydrocarbons--like propane--saturate the soil and some low-lying areas. These heavy hydrocarbons displace other gases--which are probably necessary for photosynthesis and respiration. (I'd know for sure if I hadn't sent that equipment up in a fireball--a fireball made worse by the flammable gas near the equipment.)</p>
 <p>This explains the specialized organs we're seeing! The cnideria probably filter essential gases out of the atmosphere and funnel them to photosynthetic tissue. The bulbos store gases--and since our little fire is the result of oxygen and hydrogen on a bulbo, those are probably the gases stored. We have evidence that the photobionts require oxygen--much like organisms on Earth--and have complex means to gather and store it. Even more interesting--if these photobionts can gather gases with specialized organs, they must have a means of circulating it to photosynthetic tissue throughout the organism. This explains the polystems--root-like structures are used to get minerals out of the soil, but many stems make it easier to supply them with the gases they need to survive. It also means we should look for something like a circulatory system.</p>
 <p>Plants have only two organ types--photosynthetic and reproductive--but photobionts evidently have several specialized organs for processing Epsilon Prime's unique atmosphere. (Of course, we haven't found reproductive organs yet, so maybe plants are one up there.)</p>
 <p>That does leave the mystery of where all these hydrocarbons came from.</p>

 <%include file="jane_header.html"/>
 <p>Hello ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>Scientists have long assumed all life is cellular. All of the life we've found on earth is made of cells, (unless you buy that viri are alive) and we can't think of any other efficient way for life to evolve (there has to be something that's simple enough to arise randomly, and it has to be able to concentrate nutrients so it needs a membrane to separate the inside from the outside, and lipids form bilayers so easily) so we expect that life of Epsilon Prime is also cellular. But science is only science if it's tested--which means we need tissue samples from these photobionts.</p>
 <p>That species you just tagged, the gordy tree, should be perfect--it's big, and the rover needs a large piece of photobiont to produce multiple slides--cutting paper-thin slips of tissue with a robot is not easy. The gordy tree also has branches I can lop off--I can look at stem tissue without destroying the entire organism. Please find additional instances of the gordy tree for our tests.</p>
 <p>We've named these organisms "photobionts." They share many qualities with Earth's plants, but not an evolutionary lineage--that is, they aren't descended from ancient terrestrial algal scum found only on Earth. These organisms might be sessile, possibly photosynthetic primary producers, but they are not "plants." But sessile photosynthetic organism is a mouthful, so we're sticking with photobiont.</p>

 <p>Hello ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>After taking tissue samples from the gordy trees you found for us, we made very thin slices of it and placed them under our science rover's microscope. Take a look!</p>
 ${msg.embed_image('cell_slide.jpg', 800, 450)}
 <p>The gordytrees are cellular; our null hypothesis is confirmed. It seems that the cells are arranged into filaments, and those filaments form a tissue lattice--I suppose the flesh of the gordy tree might have a texture similar to that of a very firm mushroom. Note that the purple pigment (which is probably a photosynthetic compound, but I guess we'll have to hope for a subsequent expedition to figure that out since I destroyed our equipment) is diffused throughout the cell--which makes it different from Earth's plants, where photosynthetic pigments appear as little dots because they're confined to plastids. This makes sense; the event that created plastids was so strange and so rare that we wouldn't expect to find it on other planets. Of course, this means that the parts and organelles aren't color-coded for identification like they are on Earth--it will take time to unlock the secrets of these alien cells.</p>

 <p>Apart from being cellular, the other fundamental tenets of life are growth, death, and reproduction. Testing this seems almost too basic--but it's a new planet, so we can't assume anything.</p>
 <p>For consistency, we'll continue to look at the gordy tree since we're already exploring its cellular nature. Please find examples of two very different sizes of gordy tree, which might suggest a juvenile and an adult--they may even have different traits. Finding an example of a dead or dying organism might also show evidence of a lifecycle.  Look for organisms with different coloration that might indicate decaying pigments. Some parts may wither and fall off as the organism is no longer working to keep itself together. Also, chemical defenses against predation may no longer be effective--look for organisms that grazers are focusing on. I'll be looking for evidence of reproductive tissue in our microscope samples--and hope that methods of reproduction become apparent as we spend more time on the island.</p>

 <p>Thanks for your help so far, ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()}.</p>
 <p>Now that we have determined that these species seem to follow the same <em>basic</em> rules of life as on earth--they are cellular organisms, which gather and consume energy, grow over time, and eventually die--we now want to explore other assumptions we have about life. Namely, we want to investigate the ecology of the planet. We also want to look for interesting organisms and determine their specific workings and functions.</p>
 <p>Some of these things won't be easy to determine given our constraints--our science rover can only do so much, especially since a few of the instruments are damaged. We're unable to do a lot of the things we'd do on Earth, like DNA sequencing (and there's no evidence to suggest that genes are transmitted by DNA here), isotope analysis, and getting promising young minds to devote their youth to figuring something out.</p>
 <p>But really, that makes this exciting! We're on the frontiers, and we'll make do with what we have and some creative solutions.</p>
 <p>This also means, though, that a lot of the hypotheses or conjectures we make won't be able to be proven one way or the other. Science is rarely cut and dried, and there will be a lot of unproven hypotheses on Epsilon Prime.</p>

 <p>Hello ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>I've been following along with the exciting developments you and Dr. Turing have encountered, given your rover's audio equipment. Animal life--or, no, mobile organisms. I forget myself--they don't share an evolutionary history with animals. They're mobile, and they probably aren't photosynthetic. Let's call them motobionts.</p>
 <p>Could you please wrap one with parachute material so we can find out if it's photosynthetic?</p>
 <p>Ah, levity.</p>
 <p>Now that we've seen this bristletongue creature up close we think we may have seen the same creature in earlier photos but they were too far away for us to identify:</p>
 ${msg.embed_image('zoomed_bristletongues_1.jpg', 800, 474)}
 <p>See that shape up the cliffs? It looks similar to the bristletongue you just discovered--but the shape seems slightly different. It could be a variant of the same species, or a new species altogether.</p>
 <p>When you get a moment, I'd like you to get a better picture of it. I've added a marker on your map where they were spotted in the older photo.</p>

 <p>As you can see, the creature you just tagged has a much longer neck and legs than the first bristletongue you discovered. They're clearly similar organisms, but we don't yet have enough data to determine whether they're not members of the same species.</p>
 <p>There are two likely reasons for this variation; first, the species itself might have several growth forms, based on age, sex, or heritage. Variation is an essential component of natural selection--things need to have multiple versions of a trait for one trait to have a higher survival potential than the others. Second, they could be separate but related species--species that share a recent common ancestor but diverged at some point in the past. This type of speciation--known as adaptive radiation--leads to descendants of a single species occupying several ecological niches and is common on island chains.</p>
 <p>This is pretty good evidence for some things we know about evolution on Earth. Artocos is an island, and fairly removed from other land masses, and so its biota would have evolved somewhat independently. Like Darwin discovered in the Galapagos with finches, one species can branch into several to occupy different ecological niches: in this case, feeding on something in the ground, or feeding on something in the trees.</p>
 <p>If you're interested, I've written a post about this very phenomenon on the ${msg.embed_blog_link('variation', 'XRI blog')}.</p>

 <p>Hello ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>I've noticed that the photobiont you just tagged shares some similar traits with others you've found. The apprentice tree, phoenix tail, and bristlebush likely all share a recent common ancestor.</p>
 <p>All three species share prominent orange cnideria (the feather-like structures). Given what we know of the composition of Epsilon Prime's atmosphere, and the readings we've taken from the surface, we also know that there are heavier carbon-based gases like methane and ethanol, which (without heavy winds) settle low to the ground and in the soil. These gases are typically toxic; it may well be that the orange cnideria that we see on these photobionts--and others!--are used to filter from the air the oxygen the photobionts need.</p>

 <p>We've found that the "flower"-like structures of the starspore open and close without any discernable pattern.</p>
 <p>Many of the species we've seen have organs to deal with the unique gas situation of Epsilon Prime, with the thick atmosphere and toxic carbon gases around the surface. Given that the starspore does not have either feather-like cnideria or bulbos, which we're theorizing other photobionts use for collecting and regulating gases, perhaps the "flowers" are actually valves for the capture and release of certain chemicals.</p>
 <p>It's impossible to know for sure without further experimentation.</p>

 <p>Hello ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>As you can clearly see in the photograph you just took, the species you just tagged seems to bioluminesce at night.

 <p>Based on this satellite photograph we took of that central plateau at night, there seem to be three different colours of bioluminescence in that area.</p>

 <p>We seem to have three different species of bioluminescers in this area! The ${msg.user.crosslink_catalog('groundbloom', 'SPC_PLANT015')} luminesces magenta, the ${msg.user.crosslink_catalog('bluebloom', 'SPC_PLANT031')} aqua, and the ${msg.user.crosslink_catalog('candlewort', 'SPC_PLANT022')} orange.</p>
 <p>The different colours will be as a result of different pigments present in the photobiont, but the question is, why? What purpose does it serve, and why are they different?</p>
 <p>It's possible that it's just the other pigments in each photobiont that tint the luminescence, but it may be more complicated. Maybe the three organisms--and others that bioluminesce--once had a common pollinator or spore-spreader that is active at night, which would have resulted in photobionts evolving to luminesce in the first place. The different colours suggest that they would have since differentiated for different pollinators or seed spreaders.</p>
 <p>Perhaps one pollinator only sees in higher spectrums, and the groundbloom and bluebloom have adapted to them, while the candlewort is targeting a different organism entirely.</p>
 <p>Of course, this is all pure conjecture. Unfortunately, it's hard to be sure about any of this.</p>

 <p>Hi ${msg.user.first_name.capitalize()},</p>
 <p>Of course--it must be this photobiont making the noises you detected. That was the folly of coming into science with ingrained assumptions, which I've been trying to avoid. "Plants" on Earth don't tend to make noises like that.</p>
 <p>But we've already seen that these photobionts have specialized organs that manage gas exchange--whereas Earth's plants have only photosynthetic and reproductive organs. It's possible that there are more types of organ that we don't know about--or that this might be a modification of the gas exchange organs we're already aware of. It looks like there may be a valve or sphincter within this "vampire gourd" that could be structurally similar to the human larynx--resulting in that noise as gas enters and leaves the photobiont.</p>
 <p>It goes to show that while convergent evolution might produce organisms that look very similar and occupy similar habitats, they very well might be fundamentally different organisms. It's a bit like deer versus kangaroos--their heads are nearly identical, they're both grazing herd animals--but you couldn't find two more different mammals if you tried. (OK, the platypus and either deer or kangaroos. Fine. Two more different placental mammals.)</p>
