This directory contains the phantomjs and casperjs projects used for headless Javascript testing in a Webkit environment.

http://phantomjs.org
http://casperjs.org

For the phantomjs project, the binaries for each platform are distributed by the project.
The Mac and Linux 32 binaries were downloaded and extracted into the phantomjs directory.

casperjs is not currently shipping as part of Macports or similar projects so was installed into our repository using the following commands:

$ git clone git://github.com/n1k0/casperjs.git
$ cd casperjs
$ git checkout tags/1.0.0-RC2

And then remove some cruft:
cd ../
rm -rf casperjs/.git
rm -rf casperjs/samples
rm -rf casperjs/tests/site casperjs/tests/suites casperjs/tests/testdir
